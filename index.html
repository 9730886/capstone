        <h1>How Prisms Bend Light</h1>
        <p>
            When white light passes through a glass prism, it turns into a rainbow. Why is this?
            <br>
            The shape of a prism allows it to refract, or bend, light waves when they are transmitted through it.

        <h1>Why A Rainbow?</h1>
        <p>
            White light is composed of all the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and the colors you can't see, like infrared and ultraviolet.
            <br>
            When a glass prism breaks up white light into this rainbow, each frequency (different color) refracts at a different angle, allowing you to observe them all separately.

        <h1>Light Of Other Colors</h1>
        <p>
            We've only covered white light so far. What would happen if you beamed a light of a different color, such as red, into a glass prism?
            <br>
            The light would simply refract at a different angle and not break up into a rainbow. This is because only white light is comprised of a rainbow. Other colors are simply on their own.
            <br>
            However, the light would bend at a different angle depending on its color.
